Introduction to Computing
Welcome to my personal webpage project for Introduction to Computing! This is my attempt at webpage development, showcasing a simple, responsive site built with HTML, CSS, and some external libraries.

Description
This webpage serves as an introduction to my work in computing. It features a vibrant gradient background, animated elements, and a clean design inspired by modern web standards. The site includes:

A header with my name and a developer icon.
A central display with the main title and a brief description.
A home button for navigation.
Responsive design that works on various devices.
